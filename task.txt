The test task: Using python 2.7 implement a function that: 
- Accepts an array of pairs of values as a parameter - either of datetime, or of an integer type (timestamp in UTC format)
- Accepts an additional pair of values of the same type over which the calculations are to be done 
- Yields a concurrent peak of intervals defined by the 1st parameter over the interval defined in a 2nd parameter, and the point where this maximum was reached 

Example of usage: we have numerous calls having a start, and end timestamp. 
We need to calculate a maximum number of calls that were active simultenaously in a given day / hour, and when exactly that maximum was reached.
